Identify a Reflection block \n • Starts with a heading that includes the word “Reflection” (e.g., “## Reflection Prompt”, “### Reflect on…”). \n • Ends at the next heading of the same or higher level or at EOF.\n\n2. Replace the entire block with:\n\n## CHECKPOINT:\n<one clear reflective question, 1–2 sentences, grade-8 readability>\n\n • The question must summarise the original context & bullets, tying to the lesson concept. \n • No bullet lists, sub-headings, or bold inside the question.\n\n3. Preserve all other content exactly as is.\n\n4. Whitespace \n • Keep a single blank line before and after each CHECKPOINT block. \n • Collapse >2 consecutive blank lines elsewhere into one.\n\n5. No new YAML, no external links.\n\n--- FILE START ---\n{markdown_file_contents}\n--- FILE END ---"
