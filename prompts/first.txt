Edit the following Markdown lesson outline so it’s student-ready (~700 words max, YAML unchanged).

Rules
1. Leave YAML front-matter exactly as is.
2. Keep “Learning Objectives” and “Key Takeaways” bullets verbatim.
3. For other lists:
   • If ≤2 bullets, tighten wording only.  
   • Else, expand each bullet to 1-2 sentence paragraphs **or** split under new sub-headings.
4. Keep headings; sharpen titles if dull.
5. Prose: ≤90 words per paragraph, grade-8 readability, active voice.
6. Apply any indicated tone; remove “Tone Suggestion:” lines.
7. Fulfil any “Hook Suggestion:” implicitly; delete the label itself.
8. Preserve image/audio tags; add alt text if missing.
9. No links outside the file.
